Last Updated Feb 27, 2013 by A. Viars


MDHT is used for CCDA Validation and created by Open Health Tools. Since this
project is a Java library, it does not have a free-standing application with a
UI.  This library is intergrated into the Transport Testing Tool and 
https://sitenv.org.

The only difference is that some non-CCDA JAR files which are not required for MU2 have been removed.
